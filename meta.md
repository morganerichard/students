# Usage for teachers

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and push it to [a new one](https://github.com/new) (under your GitHub organization).
    * If you make a fork of this one instead, new pull requests from your students will default to going to this repository, rather than your copy.
1. [Enable Travis CI for this repository.](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/#To-get-started-with-Travis-CI%3A)
1. Clear out the `_data/` directory.
1. Create a new directory for the current term/session/etc. with a `.keep` file in it, e.g. `_data/SOME_TERM/.keep`.
    * [More info on `.keep` files](http://stackoverflow.com/a/7229996/358804)
1. Change the `current_term` in the [`_config.yml`](_config.yml) to match the new directory.
1. Update the link in the repository description to be `http://ORG.github.io/students`.
1. Ensure that the site appears.
1. If you do a test with yourself, i.e. you place yourself in `_data/SOME_TERM/youruser.json` and push, be sure to then delete yourself again with a follow-up commit. If not, there will be your file in the fork of the students, your file will pass the tests, and there is no way of catching whether they placed the file in the right place.

## In-class

1. Have the students follow the instructions in the [README](README.md).
1. Leave comments on and merge some of the pull requests manually, so that they understand what's happening.

## Later

1. [Create a new GitHub token.](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=add_students&scopes=repo,public_repo,read:org,admin:org)
1. Run (with `ORG` and `TERM` replaced):

    ```bash
    TOKEN=... ORG=advanced-js TERM=students_2015 ruby bin/add_students.rb
    ```

which will merge the open pull requests on this repository, and add the students to the specified team.
